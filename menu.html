                <p>To begin with you coming up to me and asking my number to coordinate for college classes, passing greetings here and there whenever we saw each other, sitting together in classes, having our first night stay in your PG, moving into your flat and then the other, having hours and hours of endless nuisance conversations, dancing to the weirdest songs, you sleeping with your arms and legs wrapped around my neck and not letting me sleep (also slapping me once), sharing deepest darkest secrets to the smallest achievements that we‚Äôve had, and soooo much more. 

From being complete strangers to having you as my go to person for every damn thing, we‚Äôve come a long way. 

I never could have imagined having a person like you in my life who would change my life for the better. 

Thank you for being the amazing friend that you are. 

I love you, from all my heart and I know that we‚Äôre endgame, babe. 

I always hope and pray the best for you. I am so proud of the person you‚Äôve become. Thank you for letting me extract all my happiness by always standing next to me. 

Happy 25th Birthday, Jhalki ‚ù§Ô∏è

                <p>Jhalak bro. Finally a surprise which is not planned for you by yourself. I still remember 12th ki "SURPRISE" birthday party üòÇüòÇ. Though I told Ujjwal that you don'y deserve it, but he is too shareef to understand. Still can't believe tum dono mein same genes hain. 

Chalo birthday hai toh thodi taareef kar dete hain.
.
.
.
.
Bohot socha par kuch samajh nahi aaya üòÖ
But I have some awsome wishes for you this birthday.

First- May your family agrees and shift outside "LK" this year üòÇ
Second- May your toota hua parivaar gets back üòÇ

Jokes apart par taareef toh ab bhi nahi mili. But I still love you alot. And I like the fact that we don't have to say this to each or prove it. Bro can't wait for bali trip and more trips and shaadis. 

Chal happy birthday.. 
God bless your family, your friends, your boyfriends and your future husband. Uss bechaare pe toh abhi se taras aa rha hai üòÇüòÇ

Love you bro ‚ù§‚ù§.</p>

We‚Äôve been friends 11 years , I think. Had lots of ups and downs, but we‚Äôve still managed to stick by. So many stupid fights Ana‚Äôs everything. I can‚Äôt picture my life today, without you guys. I mean, we don‚Äôt talk everyday, but I don‚Äôt know and honestly, I don‚Äôt even want to imagine what it would have been like had you not existed.
From road trips on bikes to major trips involving flights,, we‚Äôve done it all. And so much more, coming our way, pretty soon, I‚Äôm hoping.
I honestly can‚Äôt put into words how much I love you, but I think you know. ‚ù§</p>

                <p>Happy birthday Jhalak! It's not the kind of birthday you like but I'm sure you'd find a way to celebrate it first and then cry about it that it wasn't enough (like you always do) :p

There are a lot of things to say but I won't be able to put it in words here.
So I will just say that you have a  special place in my life and I hope it remains that way. We have had a Rollercoaster ride but the best part is that you were always there with me to help me through it. 
I have no clue how you have so much energy to always be happy and optimistic.

I know you are going to make so  much fun of me for saying this but yeah i definitely agree that your presence has changed me in certain ways for good.

Be this energetic and glamorous always. Many many happy returns of the day. Hope you get all you want in life (specially a nice house and all the budget to shop).</p>

                <p>Dear Jhalak,
Hunting for a picture of us made me realise that only pictures we have together is from each other's birthday. Not a great ritual given the number of years I have known you for. So you got to start dressing up besides your much hyped (read: self hyped) birthdays. Nevertheless, I hope you're still as excited for birthday as ever because that what I expect of you. You are by far the most vibrant, happy and delightful friend I've had. Just looking at you bring a smile to my face for all the right reasons. 
I am also very proud of you. One might say you've come far from English (Hons.) at Bhagat Singh. :p
I love you. 
Hope you've spoken to me by the time you receive this message. Else consider the love discounted.
Have a beautiful birthday and wonderful year ahead. 
 
Forever,
Deepu..</p>
