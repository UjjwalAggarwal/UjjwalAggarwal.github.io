                <p>To begin with you coming up to me and asking my number to coordinate for college classes, passing greetings here and there whenever we saw each other, sitting together in classes, having our first night stay in your PG, moving into your flat and then the other, having hours and hours of endless nuisance conversations, dancing to the weirdest songs, you sleeping with your arms and legs wrapped around my neck and not letting me sleep (also slapping me once), sharing deepest darkest secrets to the smallest achievements that we’ve had, and soooo much more. 

From being complete strangers to having you as my go to person for every damn thing, we’ve come a long way. 

I never could have imagined having a person like you in my life who would change my life for the better. 

Thank you for being the amazing friend that you are. 

I love you, from all my heart and I know that we’re endgame, babe. 

I always hope and pray the best for you. I am so proud of the person you’ve become. Thank you for letting me extract all my happiness by always standing next to me. 

Happy 25th Birthday, Jhalki ❤️

                <p>Jhalak bro. Finally a surprise which is not planned for you by yourself. I still remember 12th ki "SURPRISE" birthday party 😂😂. Though I told Ujjwal that you don'y deserve it, but he is too shareef to understand. Still can't believe tum dono mein same genes hain. 

Chalo birthday hai toh thodi taareef kar dete hain.
.
.
.
.
Bohot socha par kuch samajh nahi aaya 😅
But I have some awsome wishes for you this birthday.

First- May your family agrees and shift outside "LK" this year 😂
Second- May your toota hua parivaar gets back 😂

Jokes apart par taareef toh ab bhi nahi mili. But I still love you alot. And I like the fact that we don't have to say this to each or prove it. Bro can't wait for bali trip and more trips and shaadis. 

Chal happy birthday.. 
God bless your family, your friends, your boyfriends and your future husband. Uss bechaare pe toh abhi se taras aa rha hai 😂😂

Love you bro ❤❤.</p>

                <p> That picture is what unconditional love looks like. No amount of words can describe what you mean to me. Suffice it to say that you are everything to me. Here's to hoping all your dreams come true this year. Happy Birthday. I love you forever.</p>

                <p>Happiest Birthday Jhalak.
We’ve been friends 11 years , I think. Had lots of ups and downs, but we’ve still managed to stick by. So many stupid fights Ana’s everything. I can’t picture my life today, without you guys. I mean, we don’t talk everyday, but I don’t know and honestly, I don’t even want to imagine what it would have been like had you not existed.
From road trips on bikes to major trips involving flights,, we’ve done it all. And so much more, coming our way, pretty soon, I’m hoping.
I honestly can’t put into words how much I love you, but I think you know. ❤</p>

                <p>Happy birthday Jhalak! It's not the kind of birthday you like but I'm sure you'd find a way to celebrate it first and then cry about it that it wasn't enough (like you always do) :p

There are a lot of things to say but I won't be able to put it in words here.
So I will just say that you have a  special place in my life and I hope it remains that way. We have had a Rollercoaster ride but the best part is that you were always there with me to help me through it. 
I have no clue how you have so much energy to always be happy and optimistic.

I know you are going to make so  much fun of me for saying this but yeah i definitely agree that your presence has changed me in certain ways for good.

Be this energetic and glamorous always. Many many happy returns of the day. Hope you get all you want in life (specially a nice house and all the budget to shop).</p>

                <p>Dear Jhalak,
Hunting for a picture of us made me realise that only pictures we have together is from each other's birthday. Not a great ritual given the number of years I have known you for. So you got to start dressing up besides your much hyped (read: self hyped) birthdays. Nevertheless, I hope you're still as excited for birthday as ever because that what I expect of you. You are by far the most vibrant, happy and delightful friend I've had. Just looking at you bring a smile to my face for all the right reasons. 
I am also very proud of you. One might say you've come far from English (Hons.) at Bhagat Singh. :p
I love you. 
Hope you've spoken to me by the time you receive this message. Else consider the love discounted.
Have a beautiful birthday and wonderful year ahead. 
 
Forever,
Deepu..</p>

                <p>Happiest Birthday Jhalkiii! It has been a pleasure playing ghar ghar all of college and though dynamics might have changed but mumma still loves you 😂  Our happy point memories and roasting sessions still remain the highlight of those years! Despite being busy in our own lives and meeting less often it's safe to say we have still been able to count on each other over the years and if there's any silver lining to this pandemic/lockdown it would be us getting closer than ever (who would have thought ? :P). Cheers to our future wanderlust  and Bollywood night plans 🍻 Here's hoping to meet you soon and stuff you with everything I've learnt to cook so far 😂 Have an amazing year bro❤️ Love you!</p>

Wish you a very happy birthday. You have always been my constant weird annoying creature. I miss having egg chicken roll and momos on the roads of Malviya Nagar with you. I hope you always  keep your “How many days to go ..  ? “ excitement up and hate hugging me even after 7 good years. Happy 25th.

I can’t tell you anything that you already don’t know. But a sorry and a big fatass thank you for being there as my constant. We don’t need any bullshit nor any frills. Just some music and an empty or even a crowded dance floor, and we are sorted. I hope that i get to see you soon as it’s been bloody long. 
Happy birthday partner. 
Party like the Jhalla that you are❤️.</p>

                <p>Happiest Birthday to the most craziest person in my friend circle. ❤️ 
I’m super proud of you, all that you’ve achieved in life and continue to do so. Those once in a while phone call updates are enough to bind us and keep us sane. Hahaha thank you for ALL the gossip!! Have a kickass lockdown celebration because you deserve every bit of it. 🥂🍾🎂💃🏻
Lots of love, Divya.</p>

                <p>Happy Birthdayy Jhalak! From partying like mad people in our pg to  sophisticated lunching outside, we have all come a long way. It's been so nice to have known you for all this time and your stories never fail to bring a smile on my face. Be crazy and I miss you until next time we meet and click ugly pictures again. 
Love, Ila,</p>
